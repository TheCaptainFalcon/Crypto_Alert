# Crypto Tracker


## Description:

This app is designed to track Cryptocurrencies across both Centralized (CEX) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and send alerts via SMS or through email when certain preselected or customized conditions are met.

Alerts can be distinguished based on price points, percentage based increases/decreases, or a reoccurring time-based event.


## Purpose:

To provide a FREE resource that can accurately track and send catered price reports without delay.

Many available apps can achieve this, but are far too slow to be reliable when volatility is at stake.
In addition, they may require third-party applications, which access your portfolio and can serve as a security vulnerability.
